My goal for 2024 was to read 25 books, and I'm glad to say I read 26 books. The last one was literally completed 10 minutes before the new year, but there's no question that it counts. Here's an overview of what I read and any highlights or special mentions. Any spoilers in this post will be explicitly marked and hidden by default.


## What I read {#what-i-read}

This was the year of Brandon Sanderson for me as I finally got around to seeing what all the fuss was about. I was instantly hooked into the Cosmere after Mistborn. I read a few other incredible books and started a few series I aim to finish in 2025.

## A Note on Brandon Sanderson {#a-note-on-brandon-sanderson}

Brandon Sanderson has become increasingly popular over the past few years and is no doubt one of the most successful currently living fantasy authors. He appears to care very much about his fans and providing them with not just quality art but also a level of engagement I've never seen another author have. He understands what it's like to be part of a "fandom" and he very much understands how to cater to that. This, no doubt, creates readers of his that are more drawn in by _him_ and not his work, but in my view, this isn't a bad thing at all. Because of Sandersons books, I very much branched out to read some other incredible authors over the past year and am continuing to do so.

There are 3 big reasons why I like Brandon Sanderson:

-   The Cosmere magic system
-   His unparalleled plot organization
-   The thorough demonstrations of "crisis of faith."


### Magic System {#magic-system}

I'm a programmer by trade and have always loved to tinker with things and topics. Usually this manifests by me spending 3 months learning everything I can about a topic until I get bored and reach for another. It's been everything from chemistry to mathematical models, to coffee making, to "homelabbing." Sometimes they result in a Hobby and other times it just results in knowledge gained. The Cosmere magic system is demonstrated in a scientific way. There's rules, reproducible behavior, management, atomic references, and natural occurences. Sanderson created a "force of nature" not just "magic." This has yielded something interesting for me to _learn_ about and parse as different aspects are revealed in different books.

Most other magic systems I've read consist of only two things: Energy and Expense. A character, via some destiny, prophecy, or magical circumstance gets a great amount of energy to expend to use "magic" and that's about as deep as it gets. A lot of times, the world has been affected by magic, but it's always this ambiguous _thing_ that just provides powers some how or 1 or 2 unique properties. There's no real logic to **how** those things happen, it just sort of does. The magic system in the Cosmere has a logic to it, that supports the surface level effects and grantings of power that characters have. As I said earlier, you learn about it as more of a "force" rather than a "layer of _something_" placed on top of a world/character. This depth has really satisfied the learning side of my brain and it's keeping me very engaged in what Sanderson is writing.


### Plot Organization {#plot-organization}

Brandon Sanderson has created a lot of content on the Internet about his process for writing. As far as I understand it, he's process requires meticulous planning at the beginning with an outline or two and only then doesn't he begin to write the actual story itself. It's this process that yields to very satisfying payoffs and foreshadowing. In several books, there's always a _minor detail_ which is later used to answer a big question later in the series. He's able to weave the story and connections about relentlessly which produces an extremely satisfying read. So many surprising moments with things that in retrospect were obvious occur that it just leaves plot points very satisfying and makes for fun re-reads.


### Faith and Philosophy {#faith-and-philosophy}

I'm an "ex-vangelical." The details of my faith journey are for another post (or blog entirely) but one thing I find myself relating to with Sandersons characters in several series, is how characters deal with a crisis of faith. That doesn't always mean faith in a god, but also faith in religion as a concept, in a philosophy, or a person. It's actually incredibly moving to see so many personal feelings I've had and dealt/are dealing with laid out on a page.

Sanderson is (was?) a Mormon and had I known that going in, I probably would have been more hesitant to read his work. But after having read it, if I didn't know better, I'd say that he's had the very same struggles I had but maybe with just a different outcome. I very much appreciate this honesty. A lot of other "faith-filled" writers will frequently take one of 2 approaches to these things:

-   Omit them entirely to avoid engaging with "tough questions"
-   Make it so obviously a "short-coming" of a character that is later proved to be "obviously false."

Sanderson takes this topic with much more care than other writers do and doesn't seek to answer things really but instead provide an interesting perspective on how various characters deal with these things. He never hits you over the head or makes an outcome too obvious or "on the nose." It really is moving to someone who's struggled with these things as I have and still do.


## Favorites of 2024 {#favorites-of-2024}


### Oathbringer {#oathbringer}

Oathbringer is by far my favorite book of the Stormlight Archive, and my favorite Brandon Sanderson book by a long shot. The main character story arc that takes place is not only a dark and somewhat gruesome one, but one that still brings hope. One philosphical question I've always had was, "What constitutes a person being 'too far gone' to have hope of redemption in life?" and Oathbringer speaks to that beautifully.

This was my favorite read of 2024


### Hero of Ages {#hero-of-ages}

This was the first Sanderson series I completed and the last 100 pages really just floored me.  This was a great introduction to Sanderson and is an eloquent example of the level of his plot planning. My wife is currently reading this and I know she's going to cry :)


### The Will of the Many {#the-will-of-the-many}

Picked this up on a whim and was not disappointed. The world building, character development, and mysteries are just exceptionally well done and yield a fun read. This book wasn't perfect, but definitely worth the purchase and time to read.


### Project Hail Mary {#project-hail-mary}

This book is filled to the brim with science and physics explanations as well as biochemistry explanations and illustrations all without being boring or dense. Andy Wier (also author of _The Martian_) paints this incredible science fiction story with such care and detail, while never sacrificing narrative or character development. For a quick read (I finished in about 2.5 reading sessions) it's so worth it.

My only qualm with this book was that the "ending-ending" felt a little unsatisfying and cheesy even though it is "poetic" in it's own rite.


### Hyperion {#hyperion}

About 100 pages in this book and I was confused and unmotivated to finish. The structure is very strange and takes a while to understand and follow. It'll probably be surprising to most readers, once you're about halfway through the book, that the structure up till that point is the structure of the whole thing.

That being said, once I understood the structure I was instantly immersed in the events. This is an 80's sci-fi that reads a little bit like _Dune_ which is sort of "slow" in a way while everything is building. The narrative is very non-linear but once things click, than things _really_ click.

There's a pretty gut wrenching story about halfway through the book that, as a father, deeply affected me. So be warned


## Disappointments {#disappointments}

There wasn't _much_ that I didn't like this year as I didn't read a whole lot and was committed to the Cosmere, but there are a few books I was disappointed with.


### Elantris {#elantris}

This book was good, but was definitely Sandersons weakest work. It's slow at times and I think struggles to establish what it is until about mid-way through. It's a good introduction to Sanderson still, if you're disciplined enough to just force yourself through the book, and would also act as a "there's where to go but up from here" situation once you pgress through the rest of the Cosmere. Mistborn Era 1 is probably the best intro to Sanderson though if I had to choose.


### The Blighted Stars {#the-blighted-stars}

I wanted so badly to like this book. The type of story is right up my alley, but it just fell very short, short enough that I'm probably just DNF-ing this series since I've heard that this book is the best one.

The good parts are **good**. The story, the characters, the setting, the socio-economic commentary... all of it is top notch. O'keefe really built an incredible world with a fascinating story which actually would satisfy the sci-fi fan in me if it wasn't for one of her stylistic choices.

There's an old film mantra I've heard several times in film commentaries: "Show Don't Tell." I think this also applies to books as well. Demonstrating instead of using exposition for a characters personality, thoughts, or feelings is better because it allows the reader to "discover" and get to know the character instead of just being told everything about them. While there is a layer in which this book follows this path, it violates it in the most irritating way. The rhythm of dialog between characters becomes a disjointed mess as every sentence results in exposition of the characters internal monologue about the sentence. This is common in books, but there's an _offbeat_ feel to it in Blight Stars, and this is never recovered from. I found myself just constantly irritated that every little word meant 2-3 sentences of inner monologue explaining what I probably already understood, especially when character has a "back and forth feeling." I found it so jarring that it took me out of the immersion of the book and made it feel like I was reading the book.


## What I'm Reading in 2025 {#what-i-m-reading-in-2025}

I have a long list of books in my TBR for the year. My goal is to read 50 books and branch out from Sci-fi/Fantasy a little bit more than 2024. I also made a deal with my wife for me to read A Court of Thorns and Roses series by Sarah J. Maas |||(romantasy) in exchange for her reading the Mistborn Trilogy. So I'm kicking the year off reading the first book in the series.

I don't have a complete concrete list but here's what I'm planning so far:


### Finishing the Cosmere {#finishing-the-cosmere}

-   An Elegant Puzzle by Will Larson
-   Tidy First? by Kent Beck


### Drama {#drama}

-   Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom
-   Stoner by John Willliams and John McGahern


### Other {#other}
