`ActiveModel` is an extremely useful piece of Rails, that extends far beyond just normal Rails models. Using `ActiveModel` to create POROs (plain old ruby objects) gives them a super power, and a familiar interface for future developers to understand how to interact with and extend them. This guide is not a replacement for the fantastic [Rails Guide on ActiveModel](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_model_basics.html), but instead aims to be an addendum of more implementation examples and explanations.
