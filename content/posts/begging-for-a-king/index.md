I grew up in an Christian evangelical household and attended church for my entire life. My divergence from that life began about 8 years ago and has since progressed to a point where I've completly de-evangelicalized myself and separated my Christian beliefs from the broader beliefs of the evangelical institution. At some point, I'll write a more thorough post about my specific experiences and why I've chosen to go down that path, but for this post there was some commentary I wanted to get out of my mind and onto "paper."

This commentary is mostly just an amalgamation of thoughts I've been having over the course of the past 10 years, since conservatives and evangelical Christians have decided to hedge their bets on Donald Trump as the leader of the free world. 

> Keep in mind, the arguments I make in this post are from the perpsective of an evangelical Christian and don't necessarily reflect the actual beliefs I hold today. This is more of a philosphical excercise than a true commentary on what I personally believe. It's the difference between truth and Truth.

## Asking for a King
There's a story in the Bible I grew up hearing quite a bit that became a constant "center of thought" for evaluating the state of the church institution and it's strong support of Donald Trump. 1st Samuel chapter 8 opens up with historical framing for the events about to take place. Samuel, and just appointed his sons Joel and Abijah as judges in Beersheba. Up until this point, Samuel held 3 key roles:

1. Judge of Israel
2. Prophet
3. Priest

Unfortunately, even though Samuel was Gods appointed leader of Israel in all 3 of those roles, his sons were corrupt. They took bribes to pass judgement tainting one of the most sacred social positions in Israel. This nicely presents my very first point: Inheritence from "Gods chosen" does not mean "Gods blessing."

Due to the hubris of Samuel's sons, the people of Israel began to demand Samuel appoint a king. The reasoning is very well outlined in 1 Samuel 8:
- Political instability
- Samuels sons were corrupt
  - When Samuel became old, he made his sons judges over Israel. The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba. Yet his sons did not walk in his ways but turned aside after gain. They took bribes and perverted justice. 1 Samuel 8:1-3
- A Desire to be like other nations
  - "Behold, you are old and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint for us a king to judge us like all the nations." 1 Samuel 8:5
- Desire for centralized leadership and military strength.
  - But the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel. And they said, “No! But there shall be a king over us, that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.” 1 Samuel 8:19-20
  - One could also understand this as, looking for protection among the perceieved threats around them.
  
Samuel prayed to God upon hearing this request. God told him, very simply, to "obey their voice... for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being kind over them." God then tells Samuel to warn them about.

## Reconciling the past is redemption
